## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

## Appeal Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project maintainers with a concise description of your grievance at **hello@lemony.ai**.

Your appeal will be reviewed and investigated by a different maintainer than the one who made the original decision, when possible.

## For Contributors

### Be Welcoming

We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, or immigration status
- Members of any gender identity or expression
- Members of any sexual orientation
- Members of any age
- People with disabilities
- People with any level of technical experience

### Be Respectful

Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.

### Be Collaborative

Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better.

### When We Disagree, Try to Understand Why

Disagreements happen. What is important is that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different and that different perspectives can be valuable for solving problems.
