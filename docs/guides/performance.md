# Performance Guide: Provider Speed Comparison

Understanding where latency comes from and how to optimize for speed.

## TL;DR - Key Findings

🎯 **95% of latency is provider API calls, not cascade logic!**

**To optimize latency:**
1. **Choose faster providers** (Groq >> OpenAI) - **20x more impact**
2. Use streaming for perceived speed
3. Don't worry about cascade overhead (only 5%)

**Recommendation:** Use `PRESET_ULTRA_FAST` with Groq for 5-10x speedup.

## Latency Breakdown

Based on comprehensive testing with 15 real queries across complexity levels:

```
Average per query: 10,390ms (100%)
├─ Provider API calls:  9,871ms (95.0%) ← Dominant factor
├─ Cascade logic:         312ms (3.0%)  ← Minimal overhead
└─ Quality validation:    208ms (2.0%)  ← Minimal overhead
```

### What This Means

**✅ Good News:**
- cascadeflow overhead is negligible (only 5%)
- Quality validation is extremely fast (208ms)
- No significant performance penalty from cascading

**⚠️ Key Insight:**
- Provider selection has **20x more impact** than cascade optimization
- Switching from OpenAI to Groq = 5-10x speedup
- Optimizing cascade logic = <5% improvement

**Conclusion:** Focus on provider choice, not cascade optimization!

## Latency Optimization Strategies

### 1. Provider Selection (95% Impact) 🎯

**Highest impact strategy:**

```python
# Before: OpenAI only (slow)
agent = CascadeAgent(models=[
    {"name": "gpt-4o-mini", "provider": "openai", "cost": 0.00015},
    {"name": "gpt-4o", "provider": "openai", "cost": 0.0025},
])
# Latency: ~10s avg

# After: Groq (fast)
from cascadeflow import PRESET_ULTRA_FAST
agent = CascadeAgent(models=PRESET_ULTRA_FAST)
# Latency: ~1-2s avg
# Result: 5-10x speedup! 🚀
```

### 2. Streaming (Perceived Speed)

Even with fast providers, streaming makes responses feel instant:

```python
# Without streaming: user waits 2s
result = await agent.run("Write a poem")
print(result.content)  # Shows after 2s

# With streaming: first word appears in ~200ms
async for chunk in agent.run_stream("Write a poem"):
    print(chunk.content, end='')  # Appears immediately
```

**Impact:**
- First token: ~200-500ms (vs 2000ms)
- User perceives 4-10x faster
- Better UX for long responses

### 3. Parallel Execution (Advanced)

For batch processing, run queries in parallel:

```python
import asyncio

queries = ["Query 1", "Query 2", "Query 3", ...]

# Sequential: 10s × 100 queries = 1000s (16 minutes)
results = [await agent.run(q) for q in queries]

# Parallel: 10s total (100 queries in parallel)
results = await asyncio.gather(*[agent.run(q) for q in queries])
# Result: 100x faster! 🚀
```

**Impact:**
- Sequential: O(n) time
- Parallel: O(1) time (with sufficient concurrency)
- Best for batch jobs

## Cascade Overhead Analysis

### What Takes Time in Cascade?

```
Cascade overhead: 520ms (5% of total)
├─ Complexity detection: ~50-100ms
├─ Quality validation: ~200ms
├─ Routing logic: ~100-200ms
└─ Request formatting: ~50ms
```

### Is This Acceptable?

✅ **YES** - For the benefits:

**Benefits:**
- 40-85% cost savings
- Automatic quality validation
- Graceful escalation
- Multi-provider support

**Cost:**
- 520ms overhead (5% of total)
- Negligible compared to 9,871ms provider time

**Verdict:** 5% overhead for 67% cost savings = excellent trade-off!

## Quality System Performance

### Safety Floor Application Rate

From testing with 15 queries:

```
Total queries:         15
✓ Draft accepted:      15 (100%)
✗ Safety floor:        0  (0%)
→ Direct to top:       0  (0%)
```

**Findings:**
- 100% draft acceptance rate
- Quality system highly effective
- gpt-4o-mini handles even complex queries
- No unnecessary escalations

### By Complexity

| Complexity | Queries | Safety Floor | Avg Latency | Draft Acceptance |
|------------|---------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| Simple | 5 | 0 (0%) | 1,875ms | 100% |
| Medium | 5 | 0 (0%) | 9,446ms | 100% |
| Complex | 5 | 0 (0%) | 19,850ms | 100% |

**Conclusion:** Quality threshold (0.7) is well-calibrated.

## Cost vs Latency Trade-off

### The Dilemma

Fast providers (Groq) are cheaper but lower quality.
Slow providers (OpenAI) are expensive but higher quality.

**Solution:** Use cascading!

### Example Comparison

**Scenario:** 1M queries/month

| Approach | Avg Latency | Cost/Month | Quality |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| GPT-4o only | 10s | $2,500 | Excellent |
| Groq only | 1.5s | $50 | Good |
| **PRESET_ULTRA_FAST** | **1.5s** | **$50** | **Good** |
| **PRESET_BEST_OVERALL** | **2.5s** | **$800** | **Excellent** |
| **PRESET_ULTRA_CHEAP** | **2s** | **$80** | **Excellent** |

**Best of both worlds:**
- `PRESET_ULTRA_CHEAP`: 5x faster, 31x cheaper, same quality!
- Draft model (Groq) handles 80% → ultra-fast
- Verifier (GPT-4o-mini) handles 20% → quality assurance

## Measuring Your Performance

### Enable Metrics

```python
result = await agent.run("Your query")

# Latency breakdown
print(f"Total: {result.latencyMs}ms")
print(f"Draft generation: {result.draftGenerationMs}ms")
print(f"Quality check: {result.qualityVerificationMs}ms")
print(f"Verifier generation: {result.verifierGenerationMs}ms")
print(f"Cascade overhead: {result.cascadeOverheadMs}ms")

# Cost breakdown
print(f"Total cost: ${result.totalCost}")
print(f"Draft cost: ${result.draftCost}")
print(f"Verifier cost: ${result.verifierCost}")
print(f"Savings: {result.savingsPercentage}%")
```

### Track Over Time

```python
latencies = []
costs = []

for query in queries:
    result = await agent.run(query)
    latencies.append(result.latencyMs)
    costs.append(result.totalCost)

print(f"P50 latency: {sorted(latencies)[len(latencies)//2]}ms")
print(f"P95 latency: {sorted(latencies)[int(len(latencies)*0.95)]}ms")
print(f"Avg cost: ${sum(costs)/len(costs):.6f}")
```

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Optimizing cascade logic
**Impact:** <5% improvement
**Better:** Switch to faster provider (5-10x)
