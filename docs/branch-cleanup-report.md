# Branch Cleanup Report

## Summary

The repository has no configured `origin` remote and only the `work` branch exists locally, so `git fetch origin <branch>` and `git diff main..origin/<branch> --stat` could not be executed for the requested branches. This report records that limitation and marks each branch for follow-up once a remote is configured or the branches are made available locally.
